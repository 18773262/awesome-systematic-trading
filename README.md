It comes with practice, the right tools and software and appropriate ongoing education.

          Algorithmic Trading with Python discusses modern quant trading methods in Python with a heavy focus on pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. After establishing an understanding of technical indicators and performance metrics, readers will walk through the process of developing a trading simulator, strategy optimizer, and financial machine learning pipeline. This book maintains a high standard of reproducibility. All code and data are self-contained in a GitHub repo. The data includes hyper-realistic simulated price data and alternative data based on real securities. Algorithmic Trading with Python (2020) is the spiritual successor to Automated Trading with R (2016). This book covers more content in less time than its predecessor due to advances in open-source technologies for quantitative analysis.

By formulating trading ideas as concrete rules, you can evaluate past performance and draw conclusions about the viability of your trading plan. Following systematic rules provides a consistent approach where you will have some degree of predictability of returns, and perhaps more importantly, it takes emotions and second-guessing out of the equation.

          Some people still view Bitcoin as a startup. But despite being declared dead many times by the mainstream media, Bitcoin grows stronger every year. What’s going on? It’s not too late to learn about Bitcoin and invest. Bitcoin’s value has grown exponentially over multiple booms and bust cycles spanning a decade. Bitcoin is an Internet-native phenomenon like Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Microsoft, and Tencent. It, therefore, benefits from the “network effect” which makes it dramatically more valuable as the network grows. But its potential value is much larger than the giant Internet companies we know so well. If Bitcoin reaches that potential, its value could rise by 50 times its current price in the coming decade. This book will help you understand the role of money in our society, the current state of debt in our economy, and how Bitcoin provides a better solution.

          Mathematically rigorous and meticulously organized, Active Portfolio Management broke new ground when it first became available to investment managers in 1994. By outlining an innovative process to uncover raw signals of asset returns, develop them into refined forecasts, then use those forecasts to construct portfolios of exceptional return and minimal risk, i.e., portfolios that consistently beat the market, this hallmark book helped thousands of investment managers. Active Portfolio Management, Second Edition, now sets the bar even higher. Like its predecessor, this volume details how to apply economics, econometrics, and operations research to solving practical investment problems, and uncovering superior profit opportunities. It outlines an active management framework that begins with a benchmark portfolio, then defines exceptional returns as they relate to that benchmark.

          The world of investing normally sees experts telling us the “right” way to manage our money. How often do these experts pull back the curtain and tell us how they invest their own money? Never. How I Invest My Money changes that. In this unprecedented collection, 25 financial experts share how they navigate markets with their own capital. In this honest rendering of how they invest, save, spend, give, and borrow, this group of portfolio managers, financial advisors, venture capitalists and other experts detail the “how” and the “why” of their investments. They share stories about their childhood, their families, the struggles they face and the aspirations they hold. Sometimes raw, always revealing, these stories detail the indelible relationship between our money and our values. Taken as a whole, these essays powerfully demonstrate that there is no single “right” way to save, spend, and invest. We see a kaleidoscope of perspectives on stocks, bonds, real assets, funds, charity, and other means of achieving the life one desires. With engaging illustrations throughout by Carl Richards, How I Invest My Money inspires readers to think creatively about their financial decisions and how money figures in the broader quest for a contented life.

          This does not mean leverage must be avoided altogether, but it does mean that it needs to be used safely.

          Quantitative Momentum brings momentum investing out of Wall Street and into the hands of individual investors. In his last book, Quantitative Value, author Wes Gray brought systematic value strategy from the hedge funds to the masses; in this book, he does the same for momentum investing, the system that has been shown to beat the market and regularly enriches the coffers of Wall Street’s most sophisticated investors. First, you’ll learn what momentum investing is not: it’s not ‘growth’ investing, nor is it an esoteric academic concept. You may have seen it used for asset allocation, but this book details the ways in which momentum stands on its own as a stock selection strategy, and gives you the expert insight you need to make it work for you. You’ll dig into its behavioral psychology roots, and discover the key tactics that are bringing both institutional and individual investors flocking into the momentum fold.

          A breakthrough trading book that provides powerful insights on profitable technical patterns and strategies The Art and Science of Technical Analysis is a groundbreaking work that bridges the gaps between the academic view of markets, technical analysis, and profitable trading. The book explores why randomness prevails in markets most, but not all, of the time and how technical analysis can be used to capture statistically validated patterns in certain types of market conditions. The belief of the book is that buying and selling pressure causes patterns in prices, but that these technical patterns are only effective in the presence of true buying/selling imbalance. The Art and Science of Technical Analysis is supported by extensive statistical analysis of the markets, which will debunk some tools and patterns such as Fibonacci analysis, and endorse other tools and trade setups. In addition, this reliable resource discusses trader psychology and trader learning curves based on the author’s extensive experience as a trader and trainer of traders.

Great intelligence and good luck are not required.“ William Bernstein‘s commonsense approach to portfolio construction has served investors well during the past turbulent decade—and it‘s what made The Four Pillars of Investing an instant classic when it was first published nearly a decade ago. This down-to-earth book lays out in easy-to-understand prose the four essential topics that every investor must master: the relationship of risk and reward, the history of the market, the psychology of the investor and the market, and the folly of taking financial advice from investment salespeople.

          The design of trading algorithms requires sophisticated mathematical models backed up by reliable data. In this textbook, the authors develop models for algorithmic trading in contexts such as executing large orders, market making, targeting VWAP and other schedules, trading pairs or collection of assets, and executing in dark pools. These models are grounded on how the exchanges work, whether the algorithm is trading with better-informed traders (adverse selection), and the type of information available to market participants at both ultra-high and low frequency. Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading is the first book that combines sophisticated mathematical modelling, empirical facts and financial economics, taking the reader from basic ideas to cutting-edge research and practice. If you need to understand how modern electronic markets operate, what information provides a trading edge, and how other market participants may affect the profitability of the algorithms, then this is the book for you.

          Liquid markets generate hundreds or thousands of ticks (the minimum change in price a security can have, either up or down) every business day. Data vendors such as Reuters transmit more than 275,000 prices per day for foreign exchange spot rates alone. Thus, high-frequency data can be a fundamental object of study, as traders make decisions by observing high-frequency or tick-by-tick data. Yet most studies published in financial literature deal with low frequency, regularly spaced data. For a variety of reasons, high-frequency data are becoming a way of understanding market microstructure. This book discusses the best mathematical models and tools for dealing with such vast amounts of data.

          The application of AI to financial trading is still a nascent field, although at the time of writing there are a number of other books available that cover this topic to some extent. Many of these publications, however, fail to show what it means to economically exploit statistical inefficiencies.

          Some hedge funds already claim to exclusively rely on machine learning to manage their investors’ capital. A prominent example is The Voleon Group, a hedge fund that reported more than six billion dollars (USD) in assets under management at the end of 2019 (see Lee and Karsh 2020). The difficulty of relying on machine learning to outsmart the financial markets is reflected in the fund’s performance of 7% for 2019, a year during which the S&P 500 stock index rose by almost 30%.

          Dark Pools is pacy, revealing, and profoundly chilling tale of how global markets have been hijacked by trading robots – many so self-directed that humans can’t predict what they’ll do next. It’s the story of the blisteringly intelligent computer programmers behind the rise of these ‘bots’. And it’s a timely warning that as artificial intelligence gradually takes over, we could be on the verge of global meltdown.

          Successful investment strategies are specific implementations of general theories. An investment strategy that lacks a theoretical justification is likely to be false. Hence, an asset manager should concentrate her efforts on developing a theory rather than on backtesting potential trading rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          The purpose of this Element is to introduce machine learning (ML) tools that can help asset managers discover economical and financial theories. ML is not a black box, and it does not necessarily overfit. ML tools complement rather than replace the classical statistical methods. Some of ML’s strengths include:
          <ol>
            <li>
              a focus on out-of-sample predictability over variance adjudication
            </li>
            <li>
              the use of computational methods to avoid relying on (potentially unrealistic) assumptions
            </li>
            <li>
              the ability to “”learn”” complex specifications, including nonlinear, hierarchical, and noncontinuous interaction effects in a high-dimensional space
            </li>
            <li>
              the ability to disentangle the variable search from the specification search, robust to multicollinearity and other substitution effects.
