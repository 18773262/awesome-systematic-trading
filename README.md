[ETF Arbitrage: Intraday Evidence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jT5rPW8c8Jb0dM01vJfvQsCkKOfVOxWQ/view?usp=sharing)

- We use two extremely liquid S&P 500 ETFs to analyze the prevailing trading conditions when
mispricing allowing arbitrage opportunities is created. While these ETFs are not perfect
substitutes, we show that their minor differences are not responsible for the mispricing. Spreads
increase just before arbitrage opportunities, consistent with a decrease in liquidity. Order
imbalance increases as markets become more one-sided and spread changes become more
volatile which suggests an increase in liquidity risk. The price deviations are economically
significant (mean profit of 6.6% p.a. net of spreads) and are followed by a tendency to quickly
correct back towards parity.


[The Limits of Arbitrage: Evidence from Exchange Traded Funds](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mQnitFn-j8r3AQcHUCVoFEUUDzHD_iFC/view?usp=sharing)

- Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) consistently trade away from their net asset value.
In violation of market efficiency, these discounts vary substantially over time and are
found to be significant in the explanation of future returns. Returns to simple strategies
which incorporate information in the variation of discounts outperform buy-and-hold
strategies by an annualized 15%, net of transaction costs, but only expose the investor
to about one fifth the risk. ETFs, on average, are found to be about 17% more volatile
than their underlying assets; 70% of the excess volatility can be explained by proxies
for transaction and holding costs which inhibit successful arbitrage. The findings in this
paper are consistent with noise trader models of costly arbitrage and are inconsistent
with hypotheses of financial market efficiency.

[Abnormal returns with momentum/contrarian strategies using exchange-traded funds](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OKm2ExNpKUBJUooQDrG8jqvte11O_Fgs/view?usp=sharing)

- Investing in portfolios of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provides abnormal
returns that exceed transactions costs, when returns are adjusted for risk using Fama and
French’s three-factor model. Short formation and holding periods of one day to one week
provide abnormal contrarian returns, as past losers become winners and past winners
become losers. Medium formation and holding periods of 4–39 weeks provide abnormal
momentum returns, as past winners keep winning and past losers keep losing. Abnormal
returns for portfolios of ETFs result in an asset allocation setting including all four types of
ETFs, namely domestic, international, sector, and bond ETFs, with contrarian returns
maximised over a one-day formation and holding period, and with momentum returns
maximised over a 20-week formation and holding period.

[Do Demographic Changes Affect Risk Premiums? Evidence from International Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ezyqsb1E7U3pdcQX5qUwSYtCJdv2P5MQ/view?usp=sharing)

- We examine the link between equity risk premiums and demographic changes using a very long
sample over the twentieth century for the US, Japan, UK, Germany and France, and a shorter sample
covering the last third of the twentieth century for fifteen countries. We find that demographic
variables significantly predict excess returns internationally. However, the demographic
predictability found in the US by past studies for the average age of the population does not extend
to other countries. Pooling international data, we find that, on average, faster growth in the fraction
of retired persons significantly decreases risk premiums. This demographic predictability of risk
premiums is strongest in countries with well-developed social security systems and lesser-developed
financial markets.

[Overreaction and Trading Strategies in European iShares](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15PAWAOooBKM6h9mMEkyU-ObFYhfTDrG1/view?usp=sharing)

- This paper examines the forecasting power of German, UK and French iShares
for the next day returns of the underlying Morgan Stanley country equity indexes and
assesses whether European iShares overreact to developments after the close of European
trading. The findings indicate that although deviations of European iShare prices from
net asset values (NAVs) at the close of US trading have significant forecast power for
next day NAV returns, they overpredict. Deviations of closing iShare prices from their
NAVs also lead to next day iShare price reversals that average roughly 3/8 of the size of
the deviations. Finally, the paper demonstrates the profitability of trading rules that
exploit the tendency of European iShares to overreact to late day US trading activity.


[Understanding ETNs on VIX Futures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qGX7QHElz0WqXOM77SPXCl9GYzNMCBtd/view?usp=sharing)

- This paper aims to improve transparency in the market for direct, leveraged and inverse exchange-
traded notes (ETNs) on VIX futures. The first VIX futures ETNs were issued in 2009. Now there are about 30 of them, with a market cap of about $3 billion and trading volume on some of
these products can reach $5 billion per day. Yet volatility trading is highly complex and regulators
should be concerned that many market participants lack sufficient understanding of the risks they
are taking. We recommend that exchanges, market-makers, issuers and potential investors, as well
as regulators, read this paper to improve their understanding of these ETNs.
We provide a detailed explanation of the roll yield and convexity effects that drive the returns
on VIX futures ETNs, and we track their volatility and assess their performance over an eight-year
period starting in March 2004, by replicating their values using daily close VIX futures prices. We
explain how ETN issuers can construct almost perfect hedges of their suite of ETNs and control their
issue (most ETNs are callable) to make very significant profits under all bootstrapped scenarios.
However, market knowledge has precipitated front-running of the issuer’s hedging activities, making
profits more difficult to control. Moreover, for hedging the ETNs such large positions must be taken
on VIX futures that the ETN market now leads the VIX futures that they are supposed to track.
The result has been an evident increase in the volatility of VIX futures since 2009. If this increase
in statistical volatility induces an increase in VIX futures implied volatility, a knock-on effect would
be higher prices of VIX options whilst S&P options are unaffected.
A previous discussion paper, Alexander and Korovilas (2012), provided incontrovertible evi-
dence that single positions on direct VIX futures ETNs of any maturity – including mid-term and
longer-term trackers – could only provide a diversification/hedge of equity exposure during the first
few months of a great crisis of similar magnitude to the banking collapse in late 2008. By contrast,
the present discussion paper shows that some highly attractive long-term investment vehicles can
be simply constructed by holding certain portfolios of VIX futures ETNs. In particular, we intro-
duce a new class of ‘roll-yield arbitrage’ ETN portfolios which we call ETN2
(because they allocate between direct and inverse VIX futures tracker ETNs) and ETN3 portfolios (that allocate between static and dynamic ETN2). These portfolios have positive exposure to mid-term direct-tracker ETNs and (typically) negative exposure to short-term direct-tracker ETNs (equivalently, positive exposure to short-term inverse-tracker ETNs). Their unique risk and return characteristics make
them highly attractive long-term investments, as well as superb diversifiers of stocks, bonds and
commodities.

[Adaptive Asset Allocation: A Primer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s8gwV5xUJQzVm2ODTiUlkbS4U6yYXSBN/view?usp=sharing)

- Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is the most widely used method to construct portfolios
which maximize expected returns at different levels of risk. Investors often use long-term
average asset returns and risks to find optimal portfolios, but these long-term estimates are
subject to large errors in the intermediate term. As small errors in estimates can lead to large
errors in portfolios formed using MPT, investors add heuristic constraints to produce more
intuitive and diversified portfolios than MPT would prescribe. Unfortunately, these heuristic
adjustments often drive portfolios far away from optimal values. In this paper, we describe
methods of portfolio optimization that rely on shorter term estimates of risk and return,
and which change through time in response to observed changes in markets. In stepwise
fashion we demonstrate how using shorter-term rolling estimates of risk, diversification, and
returns delivers more resilient portfolios which thrive in good times - and bad.

[Long-Term Return Reversal: Evidence from International Market Indices](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bVln9ouXZZ_wkc7lKVmMiw4u6W3hLP6A/view?usp=sharing)

- This paper documents evidence of reversals in the long-term returns of international equity
markets. We use recent short-term performance to better select contrarian securities that
appear ready to reverse. Our late-stage contrarian strategy consistently provides stronger
evidence of long-term return reversal than does the traditional pure contrarian strategy when
applied to developed and emerging market indices. Despite an absence of cross-sectional
contrarian profits for developed markets in our post-1989 subsample, longitudinal analysis
provides strong evidence of reversals during this period. Overall, our results suggest that the
reversal of long-term returns may be stronger and more pervasive than is generally
understood.

[Are There Exploitable Trends in Commodity Future Prices?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SCXgmejgzm0EEM8EsDtc4dgeHHRqkLxv/view?usp=sharing)

- We provide evidence that a simple moving average timing strategy, when applied to portfolios of commodity futures, can generate superior performance to the buy-and-hold strategy. The outperformance is very robust. It can survive the transaction costs in the futures markets, it is not concentrated in a particular subperiod, and it is robust to short-sale constraint, alternative specifications of the moving average lag length, and alternative construction of the continuous time-series of futures prices. The outperformance of the timing strategy is stronger during recession and with high investor sentiment, which likely proxies for high real interest rates. Finally, we confirm that the outperformance of the moving average timing strategy in the commodity
futures comes from the successful timing of the market portfolio.

[Assessing the profitability of intraday opening range breakout strategies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HTVW_A3huK1QU4JtQwMbryhT_6fdtCeh/view?usp=sharing)

- Is it possible to beat the market by mechanical trading rules based on historical and publicly
known information? Such rules have long been used by investors and in this paper, we test
the success rate of trades and profitability of the Open Range Breakout (ORB) strategy. An
investor that trades on the ORB strategy seeks to identify large intraday price movements
and trades only when the price moves beyond some predetermined threshold. We present
an ORB strategy based on normally distributed returns to identify such days and find that
our ORB trading strategy result in significantly higher returns than zero as well as an
increased success rate in relation to a fair game. The characteristics of such an approach
over conventional statistical tests is that it involves the joint distribution of Low, High, Open
and Close over a given time horizon.

[Carry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4xoaGk2hnIK1SrydXPfAVXr0RP7sIbe/view?usp=sharing)

- We apply the concept of carry, which has been studied almost exclusively in
currency markets, to any asset. A security’s expected return is decomposed into
its “carry” – an ex-ante and model-free characteristic – and its expected price
appreciation. Carry predicts returns cross-sectionally and in time series for a host
of different asset classes, including global equities, global bonds, commodities, US
Treasuries, credit, and options. Carry is not explained by known predictors of
returns from these asset classes, and captures many of these predictors, providing
a unifying framework for return predictability. We reject a generalized version
of Uncovered Interest Parity and the Expectations Hypothesis in favor of models
with varying risk premia, where carry strategies are commonly exposed to global
recession, liquidity, and volatility risks, though none fully explain carry’s premium.

[Cross-Sectional Seasonalities in International Government Bond Returns](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ml4D19LB_iKbsY7A0VtvN0ri7nJ159Uf/view?usp=sharing)

- We are the first to document the cross-sectional return seasonality effect in international
government bonds. Using a variety of tests, we examine fixed-income securities from 22
countries for the years 1980–2018. The bonds with high (low) returns in the same-calendar
month in the past continue to overperform (underperform) in the future. The effect is robust to
many considerations, including controlling for established predictors of bond returns. Our
results support the behavioural story of the anomaly, demonstrating its highest profitability in
the periods of elevated investor sentiment and in the market segments of strong limits to
arbitrage. Nonetheless, investment application of bond seasonality might be challenging due to
high trading costs and the required short holding periods.

[Dealer Funding Costs: Implications for the Term Structure of Dividend Risk Premia](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6Js26cCgYfKGsxJzGfShgiDIHxqBaeC/view?usp=sharing)

- I show how debt-overhang funding costs to derivatives dealers’ shareholders for carrying and hedging inventory affect mid-market derivatives prices. An implication is that some supposed “no-arbitrage” pricing relationships, such as options put-call parity, frequently break down. I also explore the implications for measuring the term structure of S&P 500 dividend risk premia.

[Commodity Strategies Based on Momentum, Term Structure and Idiosyncratic Volatility](https://drive.google.com/file/d/144qccqCyeY2hJBYHkhfpPmr3nGuL8gIP/view?usp=sharing)

- This article demonstrates that momentum, term structure and idiosyncratic volatility signals in commodity futures markets are not overlapping which inspires a novel triple-screen strategy. We show that simultaneously buying contracts with high past performance, high roll-yields and low idiosyncratic volatility, and shorting contracts with poor past performance, low roll-yields and high idiosyncratic volatility yields a Sharpe ratio over the 1985 to 2011 period which is five times that of the S&P-GSCI. The triple-screen strategy dominates the double-screen and individual strategies and this outcome cannot be attributed to overreaction, liquidity risk, transaction costs or the financialization of commodity futures markets.

[Investor Sentiment And Return Predictability in Agricultural Futures Market](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ETcudgT4B-LlUAcqUOuhPmHmMXSbv4EG/view?usp=sharing)

- This study examines the usefulness of trader-position-based sentiment index for forecasting future prices in six major agricultural futures markets. It has been found that large speculator sentiment forecasts price continuations. In contrast, large hedger sentiment predicts price reversals. Small trader sentiment hardly forecasts future market movements. An investigation was performed into various sentiment-based timing strategies, and it was found that the combination of extreme large trader sentiments provides the strongest timing signal. These results are generally consistent with the hedging-pressure theory, suggesting that hedgers pay risk premiums to transfer nonmarketable risks in futures markets. Moreover, it does not appear that large speculators in the futures markets possess any superior forecasting ability.

[Momentum in the Indian Equity Markets: Positive Convexity and Positive Alpha](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WJFZjxBFewNaqNZcPAi_068NL1DdUBOm/view?usp=sharing)

- We present effective momentum strategies over the liquid equity futures market in India. We evaluate and determine the persistence of the returns at various look-backs ranging from quarterly and weekly to more granular look-backs. We look at a universe of the liquid equity instruments traded across the Indian markets to evaluate this anomaly. We evaluate momentum across the two datasets based
on frequency - daily data and intraday bar data. On the daily scale we compare momentum with other style factors. In the intraday scale we evaluate time series momentum or absolute momentum and cross-sectional momentum or relative momentum. We demonstrate that at the optimal horizon, momentum strategies on securities in India can be a source of uncorrelated alpha. We use active risk-
budgeting at a given target risk for portfolio construction. We will show in a separate publication how it outperforms mean-variance optimization.

[Pairs Trading the Commodity Futures Curve](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1McgQJ7K5IosZf20RkXtKEzADquYhvR5n/view?usp=sharing)

- I create a pairs trade on the commodity futures curve, which captures the roll returns of commodity
futures and minimizes the standard deviation of the returns. The end results is a strategy that has an annualized arithmetic return of 6,04% and an annualized standard deviation of 2,01%. Transaction
costs and liquidity are also accounted for.
- The goal was to create and backtest a trading strategy that tries to capture the roll return component of commodity futures returns. In order to reduce the very high spot price volatility of commodity returns a market neutral systematic arbitrage was introduced through a pairs trade. The pairs trade involves taking a counter position relative to the position that is designed to capture the roll return, with as small of a negative expected return as possible.
- In practice capturing the roll return component means taking a long position into the largest dollar difference of a backwarded futures curve. And the pairs trade component is then a short position into the same curve, but with the smallest dollar difference. If the commodity futures curve was in contango, the procedure was reverts.
- It can be concluded, that both of the targets of this research were reach; capturing the roll returns of the commodity futures and minimizing volatility through a statistical arbitrage pairs trade.
- The trades designed to capture the roll returns of commodity futures returned 5,55% annually (which
was 91,9% of the portfolios total return), compared to the annualized return of the benchmark index of 0,5%.
- The pairs trade designed to minimize the standard deviation of these returns, lowered the annualized standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns from 6,37% to 2,01%, making it almost fully market neutral.

[Tactical Allocation in Commodity Futures Markets: Combining Momentum and Term Structure Signals](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jnya9zOhEfQZesrHvBkKBP3Lk_768MZE/view?usp=sharing)

- This paper examines the combined role of momentum and term structure signals for the design of profitable trading strategies in commodity futures markets. With significant annualized alphas of 10.14% and 12.66% respectively, the momentum and term structure strategies appear profitable when implemented individually. With an abnormal return of 21.02%, a novel double-sort strategy that exploits both momentum and term structure signals clearly outperforms the single-sort strategies. This double-sort strategy can additionally be utilized as a portfolio diversification tool. Interestingly, the abnormal performance of the double-sort portfolios cannot be explained by a lack of liquidity or data mining and is robust to transaction costs and to different specifications of the risk-return trade-off.

[Trading Opportunities in the Natural Gas-Propane Futures Spread](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r7QxF-3LWbWFuAS7Hzgma4QKJkWVYZkg/view?usp=sharing)

- This paper examines the statistical properties of natural gas and propane futures prices. First, it shows that each price series is integrated of the same order. Next, the study shows that the two price series are cointegrated, that is they are reliably linked in the long run. The study then exploits the cointegrating nature of the two energy price series to demonstrate the existence of profitable trading opportunities involving the two energy markets. More specifically, the paper develops and back-tests a trading strategy based on the finding that natural gas and propane prices
are cointegrated and finds that the proposed trading system yields economically significant risk-adjusted results.

[Trend Following, Risk Parity and Momentum in Commodity Futures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WY8TuDvPhnfKj8VpWjnzd1hinZcQN0Sx/view?usp=sharing)

- We show that combining momentum and trend following strategies for individual
commodity futures can lead to portfolios which offer attractive risk adjusted returns which
are superior to simple momentum strategies; when we expose these returns to a wide array of
sources of systematic risk we find that robust alpha survives. Experimenting with risk parity
portfolio weightings has limited impact on our results though in particular is beneficial to
long-short strategies; the marginal impact of applying trend following methods far outweighs
momentum and risk parity adjustments in terms of risk-adjusted returns and limiting
downside risk. Overall this leads to an attractive strategy for investing in commodity futures
and emphasises the importance of trend following as an investment strategy in the
commodity futures context.

[Trend Following Strategies in Commodity Markets and the Impact of Financialization](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZoMExywMimOmDHlQiWu6fJmV3eYJlITR/view?usp=sharing)

- This paper studies the returns to a simple trend following strategy in commodity markets and their potential drivers. We find that the strategy delivers low annualized returns in the period from 1990 to 2004 of 2.1% that show a significant increase from 2005 to 2013 to 6.5%, yielding Sharpe ratios of up to 1.8. This rise in returns coincides with the increase in participation in these mar-
kets by financial investors. Commodity markets entail particular features not shared by other assets classes, mainly physical delivery and the non-availability of infinitely lived contracts. For commodity funds that wish to maintain constant exposure, this means that they have to roll their positions to create an infinitely lived asset. This need to roll creates predictable demand for liquidity and predictable steepening and flattening of the futures curve, which can be exploited by trend following strategies. We find that the strategies returns are positively correlated to the rebalancing demand of funds thereby providing novel evidence of limits of arbitrage in these markets.


[What Drives Informed Trading Before Public Releases? Evidence from Natural Gas Inventory Announcements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLu2e3RBWllgJBbZZB_RcNKfxKvAbw3C/view?usp=sharing)

- This paper shows evidence of informed trading in the natural gas futures market before gas
inventory announcements. We examine whether traders can predict the upcoming announcement
by processing public information. The results show that the difference between the median
forecast of analysts with high historical forecasting accuracy and the consensus forecast can be
used to predict inventory surprises. This predictor explains some of the pre-announcement price
drift, suggesting that informed trading before the announcement is likely to be driven by superior
forecasting rather than by information leakage. A simple trading strategy conditioned on the
predictor would have generated an annualized Sharpe ratio of 1.26.

It comes with practice, the right tools and software and appropriate ongoing education.

          Algorithmic Trading with Python discusses modern quant trading methods in Python with a heavy focus on pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. After establishing an understanding of technical indicators and performance metrics, readers will walk through the process of developing a trading simulator, strategy optimizer, and financial machine learning pipeline. This book maintains a high standard of reproducibility. All code and data are self-contained in a GitHub repo. The data includes hyper-realistic simulated price data and alternative data based on real securities. Algorithmic Trading with Python (2020) is the spiritual successor to Automated Trading with R (2016). This book covers more content in less time than its predecessor due to advances in open-source technologies for quantitative analysis.

By formulating trading ideas as concrete rules, you can evaluate past performance and draw conclusions about the viability of your trading plan. Following systematic rules provides a consistent approach where you will have some degree of predictability of returns, and perhaps more importantly, it takes emotions and second-guessing out of the equation.

Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications.

          Some people still view Bitcoin as a startup. But despite being declared dead many times by the mainstream media, Bitcoin grows stronger every year. What’s going on? It’s not too late to learn about Bitcoin and invest. Bitcoin’s value has grown exponentially over multiple booms and bust cycles spanning a decade. Bitcoin is an Internet-native phenomenon like Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Microsoft, and Tencent. It, therefore, benefits from the “network effect” which makes it dramatically more valuable as the network grows. But its potential value is much larger than the giant Internet companies we know so well. If Bitcoin reaches that potential, its value could rise by 50 times its current price in the coming decade. This book will help you understand the role of money in our society, the current state of debt in our economy, and how Bitcoin provides a better solution.

          Mathematically rigorous and meticulously organized, Active Portfolio Management broke new ground when it first became available to investment managers in 1994. By outlining an innovative process to uncover raw signals of asset returns, develop them into refined forecasts, then use those forecasts to construct portfolios of exceptional return and minimal risk, i.e., portfolios that consistently beat the market, this hallmark book helped thousands of investment managers. Active Portfolio Management, Second Edition, now sets the bar even higher. Like its predecessor, this volume details how to apply economics, econometrics, and operations research to solving practical investment problems, and uncovering superior profit opportunities. It outlines an active management framework that begins with a benchmark portfolio, then defines exceptional returns as they relate to that benchmark.

          The world of investing normally sees experts telling us the “right” way to manage our money. How often do these experts pull back the curtain and tell us how they invest their own money? Never. How I Invest My Money changes that. In this unprecedented collection, 25 financial experts share how they navigate markets with their own capital. In this honest rendering of how they invest, save, spend, give, and borrow, this group of portfolio managers, financial advisors, venture capitalists and other experts detail the “how” and the “why” of their investments. They share stories about their childhood, their families, the struggles they face and the aspirations they hold. Sometimes raw, always revealing, these stories detail the indelible relationship between our money and our values. Taken as a whole, these essays powerfully demonstrate that there is no single “right” way to save, spend, and invest. We see a kaleidoscope of perspectives on stocks, bonds, real assets, funds, charity, and other means of achieving the life one desires. With engaging illustrations throughout by Carl Richards, How I Invest My Money inspires readers to think creatively about their financial decisions and how money figures in the broader quest for a contented life.

          This does not mean leverage must be avoided altogether, but it does mean that it needs to be used safely.

          Quantitative Momentum brings momentum investing out of Wall Street and into the hands of individual investors. In his last book, Quantitative Value, author Wes Gray brought systematic value strategy from the hedge funds to the masses; in this book, he does the same for momentum investing, the system that has been shown to beat the market and regularly enriches the coffers of Wall Street’s most sophisticated investors. First, you’ll learn what momentum investing is not: it’s not ‘growth’ investing, nor is it an esoteric academic concept. You may have seen it used for asset allocation, but this book details the ways in which momentum stands on its own as a stock selection strategy, and gives you the expert insight you need to make it work for you. You’ll dig into its behavioral psychology roots, and discover the key tactics that are bringing both institutional and individual investors flocking into the momentum fold.

          A breakthrough trading book that provides powerful insights on profitable technical patterns and strategies The Art and Science of Technical Analysis is a groundbreaking work that bridges the gaps between the academic view of markets, technical analysis, and profitable trading. The book explores why randomness prevails in markets most, but not all, of the time and how technical analysis can be used to capture statistically validated patterns in certain types of market conditions. The belief of the book is that buying and selling pressure causes patterns in prices, but that these technical patterns are only effective in the presence of true buying/selling imbalance. The Art and Science of Technical Analysis is supported by extensive statistical analysis of the markets, which will debunk some tools and patterns such as Fibonacci analysis, and endorse other tools and trade setups. In addition, this reliable resource discusses trader psychology and trader learning curves based on the author’s extensive experience as a trader and trainer of traders.

Great intelligence and good luck are not required.“ William Bernstein‘s commonsense approach to portfolio construction has served investors well during the past turbulent decade—and it‘s what made The Four Pillars of Investing an instant classic when it was first published nearly a decade ago. This down-to-earth book lays out in easy-to-understand prose the four essential topics that every investor must master: the relationship of risk and reward, the history of the market, the psychology of the investor and the market, and the folly of taking financial advice from investment salespeople.

          The design of trading algorithms requires sophisticated mathematical models backed up by reliable data. In this textbook, the authors develop models for algorithmic trading in contexts such as executing large orders, market making, targeting VWAP and other schedules, trading pairs or collection of assets, and executing in dark pools. These models are grounded on how the exchanges work, whether the algorithm is trading with better-informed traders (adverse selection), and the type of information available to market participants at both ultra-high and low frequency. Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading is the first book that combines sophisticated mathematical modelling, empirical facts and financial economics, taking the reader from basic ideas to cutting-edge research and practice. If you need to understand how modern electronic markets operate, what information provides a trading edge, and how other market participants may affect the profitability of the algorithms, then this is the book for you.

          Liquid markets generate hundreds or thousands of ticks (the minimum change in price a security can have, either up or down) every business day. Data vendors such as Reuters transmit more than 275,000 prices per day for foreign exchange spot rates alone. Thus, high-frequency data can be a fundamental object of study, as traders make decisions by observing high-frequency or tick-by-tick data. Yet most studies published in financial literature deal with low frequency, regularly spaced data. For a variety of reasons, high-frequency data are becoming a way of understanding market microstructure. This book discusses the best mathematical models and tools for dealing with such vast amounts of data.

          The application of AI to financial trading is still a nascent field, although at the time of writing there are a number of other books available that cover this topic to some extent. Many of these publications, however, fail to show what it means to economically exploit statistical inefficiencies.

          Some hedge funds already claim to exclusively rely on machine learning to manage their investors’ capital. A prominent example is The Voleon Group, a hedge fund that reported more than six billion dollars (USD) in assets under management at the end of 2019 (see Lee and Karsh 2020). The difficulty of relying on machine learning to outsmart the financial markets is reflected in the fund’s performance of 7% for 2019, a year during which the S&P 500 stock index rose by almost 30%.

It’s the story of the blisteringly intelligent computer programmers behind the rise of these ‘bots’. And it’s a timely warning that as artificial intelligence gradually takes over, we could be on the verge of global meltdown.

          Successful investment strategies are specific implementations of general theories. An investment strategy that lacks a theoretical justification is likely to be false. Hence, an asset manager should concentrate her efforts on developing a theory rather than on backtesting potential trading rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          The purpose of this Element is to introduce machine learning (ML) tools that can help asset managers discover economical and financial theories. ML is not a black box, and it does not necessarily overfit. ML tools complement rather than replace the classical statistical methods. Some of ML’s strengths include:
          <ol>
            <li>
              a focus on out-of-sample predictability over variance adjudication
            </li>
            <li>
              the use of computational methods to avoid relying on (potentially unrealistic) assumptions
            </li>
            <li>
              the ability to “”learn”” complex specifications, including nonlinear, hierarchical, and noncontinuous interaction effects in a high-dimensional space
            </li>
            <li>
              the ability to disentangle the variable search from the specification search, robust to multicollinearity and other substitution effects.
