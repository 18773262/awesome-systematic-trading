[Are There Exploitable Trends in Commodity Future Prices?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SCXgmejgzm0EEM8EsDtc4dgeHHRqkLxv/view?usp=sharing)

- We provide evidence that a simple moving average timing strategy, when applied to portfolios of commodity futures, can generate superior performance to the buy-and-hold strategy. The outperformance is very robust. It can survive the transaction costs in the futures markets, it is not concentrated in a particular subperiod, and it is robust to short-sale constraint, alternative specifications of the moving average lag length, and alternative construction of the continuous time-series of futures prices. The outperformance of the timing strategy is stronger during recession and with high investor sentiment, which likely proxies for high real interest rates. Finally, we confirm that the outperformance of the moving average timing strategy in the commodity
futures comes from the successful timing of the market portfolio.

[Assessing the profitability of intraday opening range breakout strategies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HTVW_A3huK1QU4JtQwMbryhT_6fdtCeh/view?usp=sharing)

- Is it possible to beat the market by mechanical trading rules based on historical and publicly
known information? Such rules have long been used by investors and in this paper, we test
the success rate of trades and profitability of the Open Range Breakout (ORB) strategy. An
investor that trades on the ORB strategy seeks to identify large intraday price movements
and trades only when the price moves beyond some predetermined threshold. We present
an ORB strategy based on normally distributed returns to identify such days and find that
our ORB trading strategy result in significantly higher returns than zero as well as an
increased success rate in relation to a fair game. The characteristics of such an approach
over conventional statistical tests is that it involves the joint distribution of Low, High, Open
and Close over a given time horizon.

[Carry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4xoaGk2hnIK1SrydXPfAVXr0RP7sIbe/view?usp=sharing)

- We apply the concept of carry, which has been studied almost exclusively in
currency markets, to any asset. A security’s expected return is decomposed into
its “carry” – an ex-ante and model-free characteristic – and its expected price
appreciation. Carry predicts returns cross-sectionally and in time series for a host
of different asset classes, including global equities, global bonds, commodities, US
Treasuries, credit, and options. Carry is not explained by known predictors of
returns from these asset classes, and captures many of these predictors, providing
a unifying framework for return predictability. We reject a generalized version
of Uncovered Interest Parity and the Expectations Hypothesis in favor of models
with varying risk premia, where carry strategies are commonly exposed to global
recession, liquidity, and volatility risks, though none fully explain carry’s premium.

[Cross-Sectional Seasonalities in International Government Bond Returns](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ml4D19LB_iKbsY7A0VtvN0ri7nJ159Uf/view?usp=sharing)

- We are the first to document the cross-sectional return seasonality effect in international
government bonds. Using a variety of tests, we examine fixed-income securities from 22
countries for the years 1980–2018. The bonds with high (low) returns in the same-calendar
month in the past continue to overperform (underperform) in the future. The effect is robust to
many considerations, including controlling for established predictors of bond returns. Our
results support the behavioural story of the anomaly, demonstrating its highest profitability in
the periods of elevated investor sentiment and in the market segments of strong limits to
arbitrage. Nonetheless, investment application of bond seasonality might be challenging due to
high trading costs and the required short holding periods.

[Dealer Funding Costs: Implications for the Term Structure of Dividend Risk Premia](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6Js26cCgYfKGsxJzGfShgiDIHxqBaeC/view?usp=sharing)

- I show how debt-overhang funding costs to derivatives dealers’ shareholders for carrying and hedging inventory affect mid-market derivatives prices. An implication is that some supposed “no-arbitrage” pricing relationships, such as options put-call parity, frequently break down. I also explore the implications for measuring the term structure of S&P 500 dividend risk premia.

[Commodity Strategies Based on Momentum, Term Structure and Idiosyncratic Volatility](https://drive.google.com/file/d/144qccqCyeY2hJBYHkhfpPmr3nGuL8gIP/view?usp=sharing)

- This article demonstrates that momentum, term structure and idiosyncratic volatility signals in commodity futures markets are not overlapping which inspires a novel triple-screen strategy. We show that simultaneously buying contracts with high past performance, high roll-yields and low idiosyncratic volatility, and shorting contracts with poor past performance, low roll-yields and high idiosyncratic volatility yields a Sharpe ratio over the 1985 to 2011 period which is five times that of the S&P-GSCI. The triple-screen strategy dominates the double-screen and individual strategies and this outcome cannot be attributed to overreaction, liquidity risk, transaction costs or the financialization of commodity futures markets.

[Investor Sentiment And Return Predictability in Agricultural Futures Market](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ETcudgT4B-LlUAcqUOuhPmHmMXSbv4EG/view?usp=sharing)

- This study examines the usefulness of trader-position-based sentiment index for forecasting future prices in six major agricultural futures markets. It has been found that large speculator sentiment forecasts price continuations. In contrast, large hedger sentiment predicts price reversals. Small trader sentiment hardly forecasts future market movements. An investigation was performed into various sentiment-based timing strategies, and it was found that the combination of extreme large trader sentiments provides the strongest timing signal. These results are generally consistent with the hedging-pressure theory, suggesting that hedgers pay risk premiums to transfer nonmarketable risks in futures markets. Moreover, it does not appear that large speculators in the futures markets possess any superior forecasting ability.

[Momentum in the Indian Equity Markets: Positive Convexity and Positive Alpha](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WJFZjxBFewNaqNZcPAi_068NL1DdUBOm/view?usp=sharing)

- We present effective momentum strategies over the liquid equity futures market in India. We evaluate and determine the persistence of the returns at various look-backs ranging from quarterly and weekly to more granular look-backs. We look at a universe of the liquid equity instruments traded across the Indian markets to evaluate this anomaly. We evaluate momentum across the two datasets based
on frequency - daily data and intraday bar data. On the daily scale we compare momentum with other style factors. In the intraday scale we evaluate time series momentum or absolute momentum and cross-sectional momentum or relative momentum. We demonstrate that at the optimal horizon, momentum strategies on securities in India can be a source of uncorrelated alpha. We use active risk-
budgeting at a given target risk for portfolio construction. We will show in a separate publication how it outperforms mean-variance optimization.

[Pairs Trading the Commodity Futures Curve](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1McgQJ7K5IosZf20RkXtKEzADquYhvR5n/view?usp=sharing)

- I create a pairs trade on the commodity futures curve, which captures the roll returns of commodity
futures and minimizes the standard deviation of the returns. The end results is a strategy that has an annualized arithmetic return of 6,04% and an annualized standard deviation of 2,01%. Transaction
costs and liquidity are also accounted for.
- The goal was to create and backtest a trading strategy that tries to capture the roll return component of commodity futures returns. In order to reduce the very high spot price volatility of commodity returns a market neutral systematic arbitrage was introduced through a pairs trade. The pairs trade involves taking a counter position relative to the position that is designed to capture the roll return, with as small of a negative expected return as possible.
- In practice capturing the roll return component means taking a long position into the largest dollar difference of a backwarded futures curve. And the pairs trade component is then a short position into the same curve, but with the smallest dollar difference. If the commodity futures curve was in contango, the procedure was reverts.
- It can be concluded, that both of the targets of this research were reach; capturing the roll returns of the commodity futures and minimizing volatility through a statistical arbitrage pairs trade.
- The trades designed to capture the roll returns of commodity futures returned 5,55% annually (which
was 91,9% of the portfolios total return), compared to the annualized return of the benchmark index of 0,5%.
- The pairs trade designed to minimize the standard deviation of these returns, lowered the annualized standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns from 6,37% to 2,01%, making it almost fully market neutral.

[Tactical Allocation in Commodity Futures Markets: Combining Momentum and Term Structure Signals](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jnya9zOhEfQZesrHvBkKBP3Lk_768MZE/view?usp=sharing)

- This paper examines the combined role of momentum and term structure signals for the design of profitable trading strategies in commodity futures markets. With significant annualized alphas of 10.14% and 12.66% respectively, the momentum and term structure strategies appear profitable when implemented individually. With an abnormal return of 21.02%, a novel double-sort strategy that exploits both momentum and term structure signals clearly outperforms the single-sort strategies. This double-sort strategy can additionally be utilized as a portfolio diversification tool. Interestingly, the abnormal performance of the double-sort portfolios cannot be explained by a lack of liquidity or data mining and is robust to transaction costs and to different specifications of the risk-return trade-off.

[Trading Opportunities in the Natural Gas-Propane Futures Spread](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r7QxF-3LWbWFuAS7Hzgma4QKJkWVYZkg/view?usp=sharing)

- This paper examines the statistical properties of natural gas and propane futures prices. First, it shows that each price series is integrated of the same order. Next, the study shows that the two price series are cointegrated, that is they are reliably linked in the long run. The study then exploits the cointegrating nature of the two energy price series to demonstrate the existence of profitable trading opportunities involving the two energy markets. More specifically, the paper develops and back-tests a trading strategy based on the finding that natural gas and propane prices
are cointegrated and finds that the proposed trading system yields economically significant risk-adjusted results.

[Trend Following, Risk Parity and Momentum in Commodity Futures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WY8TuDvPhnfKj8VpWjnzd1hinZcQN0Sx/view?usp=sharing)

- We show that combining momentum and trend following strategies for individual
commodity futures can lead to portfolios which offer attractive risk adjusted returns which
are superior to simple momentum strategies; when we expose these returns to a wide array of
sources of systematic risk we find that robust alpha survives. Experimenting with risk parity
portfolio weightings has limited impact on our results though in particular is beneficial to
long-short strategies; the marginal impact of applying trend following methods far outweighs
momentum and risk parity adjustments in terms of risk-adjusted returns and limiting
downside risk. Overall this leads to an attractive strategy for investing in commodity futures
and emphasises the importance of trend following as an investment strategy in the
commodity futures context.

[Trend Following Strategies in Commodity Markets and the Impact of Financialization](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZoMExywMimOmDHlQiWu6fJmV3eYJlITR/view?usp=sharing)

- This paper studies the returns to a simple trend following strategy in commodity markets and their potential drivers. We find that the strategy delivers low annualized returns in the period from 1990 to 2004 of 2.1% that show a significant increase from 2005 to 2013 to 6.5%, yielding Sharpe ratios of up to 1.8. This rise in returns coincides with the increase in participation in these mar-
kets by financial investors. Commodity markets entail particular features not shared by other assets classes, mainly physical delivery and the non-availability of infinitely lived contracts. For commodity funds that wish to maintain constant exposure, this means that they have to roll their positions to create an infinitely lived asset. This need to roll creates predictable demand for liquidity and predictable steepening and flattening of the futures curve, which can be exploited by trend following strategies. We find that the strategies returns are positively correlated to the rebalancing demand of funds thereby providing novel evidence of limits of arbitrage in these markets.


[What Drives Informed Trading Before Public Releases? Evidence from Natural Gas Inventory Announcements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLu2e3RBWllgJBbZZB_RcNKfxKvAbw3C/view?usp=sharing)

- This paper shows evidence of informed trading in the natural gas futures market before gas
inventory announcements. We examine whether traders can predict the upcoming announcement
by processing public information. The results show that the difference between the median
forecast of analysts with high historical forecasting accuracy and the consensus forecast can be
used to predict inventory surprises. This predictor explains some of the pre-announcement price
drift, suggesting that informed trading before the announcement is likely to be driven by superior
forecasting rather than by information leakage. A simple trading strategy conditioned on the
predictor would have generated an annualized Sharpe ratio of 1.26.

          The design of trading algorithms requires sophisticated mathematical models backed up by reliable data. In this textbook, the authors develop models for algorithmic trading in contexts such as executing large orders, market making, targeting VWAP and other schedules, trading pairs or collection of assets, and executing in dark pools. These models are grounded on how the exchanges work, whether the algorithm is trading with better-informed traders (adverse selection), and the type of information available to market participants at both ultra-high and low frequency. Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading is the first book that combines sophisticated mathematical modelling, empirical facts and financial economics, taking the reader from basic ideas to cutting-edge research and practice. If you need to understand how modern electronic markets operate, what information provides a trading edge, and how other market participants may affect the profitability of the algorithms, then this is the book for you.

          This is the survival guide for trading in a world where high-frequency trading predominates in markets, accounting for upwards of 60% of trading in equities and futures, and 40% in foreign exchange.
        </li>
        <li>
          High-frequency trading is the subject of extensive debate, particularly as to whether it is beneficial for traders and markets or instead allows some traders to benefit at others expense.
        </li>
        <li>
          This book provides you with an important overview and perspective on this area, with a particular focus on how low-frequency traders and asset managers can survive in the high-frequency world.

          Successful investment strategies are specific implementations of general theories. An investment strategy that lacks a theoretical justification is likely to be false. Hence, an asset manager should concentrate her efforts on developing a theory rather than on backtesting potential trading rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          The purpose of this Element is to introduce machine learning (ML) tools that can help asset managers discover economical and financial theories. ML is not a black box, and it does not necessarily overfit. ML tools complement rather than replace the classical statistical methods. Some of ML’s strengths include:
          <ol>
            <li>
              a focus on out-of-sample predictability over variance adjudication
            </li>
            <li>
              the use of computational methods to avoid relying on (potentially unrealistic) assumptions
            </li>
            <li>
              the ability to “”learn”” complex specifications, including nonlinear, hierarchical, and noncontinuous interaction effects in a high-dimensional space
            </li>
            <li>
              the ability to disentangle the variable search from the specification search, robust to multicollinearity and other substitution effects.
